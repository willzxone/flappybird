# Flappy Bird Assembly Game
Welcome to the Flappy Bird Assembly Game! This repository contains the source code for a classic Flappy Bird game implemented in x86 assembly language for the DOS operating system. This project aims to showcase the fundamental principles of game development and low-level programming in assembly.



## Features
- Bird character that responds to user input (spacebar) for navigation.Moving obstacles with collision detection.
- Score tracking and display.
- Game over screen with a final score.

## Instructions
To run this game, you'll need a DOS emulator or a compatible environment.
Assemble and execute the provided assembly code.
Use the spacebar to control the bird's flight and avoid obstacles.
The game ends when the bird collides with an obstacle or flies out of bounds.
    
## Note
This project is intended for educational purposes and nostalgic recreation of the Flappy Bird game on older hardware and environments. It's a fun example of low-level programming and game development in assembly language.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it as a learning resource for assembly programming and game development. Have fun, and happy coding!
